# Discord GPT
This repository contains a Discord bot that uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5 language model to provide chat capabilities in three different channels: sarcasm, songwriting, and drop the mic. The bot utilizes the OpenAI API for natural language processing and responds to user messages with generated text based on the channel context.

# Prerequisites
Before running the Discord GPT bot, you need to set up a few things:

OpenAI API Key: You will need an API key from OpenAI to access the GPT-3.5 model. Visit the OpenAI website to create an account and obtain your API key.

Discord Token: Create a bot account on the Discord Developer Portal and generate a token for your bot. This token is necessary to authenticate the bot with Discord.

Channel IDs: Obtain the channel IDs for the sarcasm, songwriting, and drop the mic channels in your Discord server. These IDs will be used to direct the bot's responses to the appropriate channels.
